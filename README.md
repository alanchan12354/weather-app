## Testing
- **Manual**: In the running app, enter valid/invalid city names and verify:
  - Correct weather data and icons
  - Forecast slider and 5â€‘day panels
  - Error message on bad inputs
- **Analytics**: In GA4 RealtimeÂ â†’Â Events, confirm you see:
  - `page_view` on load
  - `search_weather` with each searched city

## Analytics
We use Google AnalyticsÂ 4 (gtag.js) to collect:
- **Automatic** `page_view` events  
- **Custom** `search_weather` events (label = city name)
